  - Symbol search (Cmd+Shift+O) — Jump to functions, classes, exports
  - File templates — Scaffold common files (React component, API route, etc.)
  - Project templates — Start from Next.js, Vite, Express, etc. boilerplates
  - Import from GitHub — Clone a repo directly into a project
  - Export to GitHub — Push a project to a new or existing repo
  - File history/versioning — View and restore previous versions of a file

  Preview & Runtime

  - Multiple terminal tabs — Run several processes simultaneously ✅
  - Console panel — Capture and display console.log output separately from terminal ✅
  - Responsive preview — Toggle between device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Preview URL sharing — Generate a shareable link for the running preview
  - Environment variables UI — Manage .env values through a settings panel instead of editing the file

  Collaboration

  - Real-time multiplayer editing — Multiple users editing the same project simultaneously (Convex's real-time subscriptions make this      
  feasible)
  - Share project links — Read-only or editable access via link
  - Comments on code — Leave comments on specific lines for async collaboration
  - Fork/remix — Let users fork public projects as starting points

  UX & Quality of Life

  - Command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) — Central hub for all actions
  - Themes — Light/dark/custom editor themes
  - Settings UI — Font size, tab size, word wrap, autosave preferences
  - Notification system — Toast notifications for AI completion, errors, deploy status
  - Undo/redo for AI changes — Checkpoint-based rollback of AI-applied edits
  - Drag-and-drop file uploads — Drop images/assets into the file explorer
  - Tab pinning — Permanently pin important tabs that can't be accidentally closed

  Deployment

  - One-click deploy — Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare from the editor
  - Deploy previews — Auto-generate preview URLs for each saved state
  - Custom domain linking — Connect a domain to a deployed project

  The highest-impact additions would likely be inline AI autocomplete, command palette, fuzzy file finder, and split panes — these are the  
  features power users expect from any modern code editor.
